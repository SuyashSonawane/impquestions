<h1 align="center">Swaping two numbers </h1>
<p>This is an important question as it is somewhat different. Here we use a simple algorithm which swaps the values of numbers.
	Here we will use a dummy variable 'c' , ask the user to input 2 numbers (say 'a' and 'b' ) , then assign the value of 'a' to 'c' (like  c=a ) , then assign the value of 'b' to 'a'  (like a=b) , then finally assign the value of 'c' to 'b'.<br>
	Here your algorithm ends , this  should looks like <br> { <br> c=a; <br> a=b; <br> b=c ; <br>}<br>
	To run this algoritm click on the run button below.<br><br>
